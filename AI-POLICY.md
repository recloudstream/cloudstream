# AI Policy

AI is a great tool. However, we want you to follow these rules regarding usage of AI in order to ensure the quality of both code and discussions.

1. Always state any AI usage in pull requests and issues. 

2. Always test code before making a pull request. We do not want to test your AI generated code. 

3. Listen to humans over computers. Contributors to CloudStream know this codebase better than an AI. 

4. You should be able to explain and fix any code you submit. We do in-depth reviews and will reject low effort contributions.
